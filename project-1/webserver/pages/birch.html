            <h3>What is Birch Renderer?</h3>
            <p>
                Birch Renderer is a python library
                for rendering HTML files and customizing
                content inside of them on the fly. Birch
                Renderer is part of my wserve experimental
                library, which was initially designed to
                play around with HTTP1.1 TCP protocol with
                python sockets.
